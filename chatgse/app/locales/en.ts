        Models: "The default model loaded is `OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo` model, which in the standard version has a token limit of 4000 per conversation. This model currently comes in two versions, `0301` and `0613`. The latter is the more recent one with improved interpretation of system messages and capabilities to handle functions (returning attribute values of a given function as JSON). Additionally, OpenAI provide a `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model with increased token limit of 16000 per conversation. This model is slightly more expensive, but can be useful for longer conversations, particularly when including the document summarisation `/prompt` injection feature."
